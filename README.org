| =derived/=                | R binary files generated by preprocessing script =00_preprocessing.org=; not need to reproduce the full analysis |
| =gazedata/=               | subdirectory containing all raw data files (385 MB)                                                              |
| =scripts/=                | subdirectory containing R scripts needed to reproduce the analysis                                               |
| =00_preprocessing.org=    | org-mode file containing pre-processing code / documentation                                                     |
| =FIXED_stimulus_list.csv= | names of the stimulus images appearing on individual displays                                                    |
| =inregion.cpp=            | little C++ script for assigning point of gaze for each data frame to an AOI (area of interest)                   |
| =onsetTimes.csv=          | word onsets measured from start of sound file (in milliseconds)                                                  |

- all data files were recorded with a Tobii T120 eyetracker sampling at 60 Hz
- all analyses were performed in R version 3.1.2, and require the following add-on packages: =plyr=, =dplyr=, =tidyr=, =Rcpp=, =ggplot2=
- main analysis is included the =*.org= files, which were written in
  emacs org-mode version 8.3.1 with noweb syntax; if you're not an
  emacs org-mode user, run the R scripts in the =scripts/=
  subdirectory in order (NB: you will need to set your working
  directory so that =inregion.cpp= is in the directory and =gazedata/=
  is a subdirectory)
